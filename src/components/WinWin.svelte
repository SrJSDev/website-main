  <h2>A Win-Win Deal!</h2>
  <p>What does a Sr. developer do, and how is it different than a Jr. developer?</p>
  <p>It boils down writing "maintainable code", in 3 simple categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean code</li>
    <li>Testable code</li>
    <li>Visible code</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These concepts are what distinguish <b>top</b> Sr. developers, and they're what I mentor
every student to be successful at.</p>
  <p>So then, developers get to build bigger, cooler stuff, and get paid better for it.</p>
  <p>And companies love the increased quality and velocity, too.</p>
  <p>That's what I call a <b>win-win</b>!!</p>
