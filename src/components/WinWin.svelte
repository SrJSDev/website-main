  <h2>A Win-Win Deal!</h2>
  <p>Q: What does a Sr. developer do, and how is it different than a Jr. developer?</p>
  <p>A: It boils down writing "maintainable code", in 3 simple categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean</li>
    <li>Testable</li>
    <li>Visible</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These concepts are what distinguish <b>top</b> Sr. developers, and they're what I mentor
every student to be successful at.</p>
  <p>Once you've completed your diploma, developers will build bigger, better systems --</p>
  <p>(and get paid more for it, too)!</p>
  <p>And companies love the increased quality and velocity of their highly trained employees.</p>
  <p>That's a real <b>win-win</b>!!</p>
